## [0.1.0] (2025-04-09)

### Added

- Adds GitHub Actions workflow for automating PyPI package publishing when version tags are created.
- Adds pre-commit configuration with ruff, mypy, and code quality hooks to ensure consistent code quality.
- Adds GPL-3.0 license file to clearly communicate how this can be used and shared.

### Changed

- Renames project from "Bug Zapper Kill Tracker" to "Unreal Zap" - now 100% more unreal.
- Simplifies installation process to use pip instead of Poetry, because life's complicated enough already.
- Modernizes project structure with improved package organization and updated dependencies for Python 3.12.
- Enhances code with better type annotations, timezone-aware datetime handling, and pathlib for file operations.
- Relocates sound files (dominating, double_kill, first_blood, etc.) to src/unrealzap/sounds/ directory. Same epicâ„¢ sounds, tidier organization.

### Removed

- Removes GitHub Pages documentation workflow that was fighting a losing battle with pyalsaaudio dependencies.
